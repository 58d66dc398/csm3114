## 1 Flutter Basic Installation and Development 

### 1.1 Flutter Configuration 

1. Describe the steps-by-step process for performing the Flutter configuration? 
	1. Download Flutter SDK from [the official site](https://docs.flutter.dev/get-started/install).
	2. Add the SDK bin file to system PATH. 
2. Describe the actions required to ensure the Flutter configuration is successfully deployed and setup on your machine. 
	1. Run `flutter doctor` to check for requirements. 
		- For Android SDK, *due to laziness*, just installing Android Studio and using it's Android SDK manager to install Command-Line Tools and Android Virtual Device (AVD) would do. 
	2. Run `flutter create app_name` to verify whether the SDK is working. 
	3. Run the app with Android Studio or Visual Studio Code with AVD to verify if everything is working well. 
3. Write a command line to update the Android licenses when performing the health checking on the Flutter configuration.
	- `flutter doctor --android-licenses`
	- `sdkmanager --licenses`
